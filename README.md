# React Photo Gallery (ft. Dogtography by Patrick)

## Description

Duration: *2 day weekend sprint*

This project was my first solo React build. The application is a photo library with a grid layout. I broke it down into three components (App, GalleryList, and GalleryItem) using props to pass data between them and axios to create route requests. Conditional rendering allows a photo to be clicked, disappear, and reveal the photo description. Below each photo is a button to "like" the corresponding photo and a running total of likes for each.

This application also features photography by up-and-coming Twin Cities photographer Patrick Winkle. The photos star my own dogs, Murphy and Bonnie.
